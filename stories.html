    <p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;background-color: aliceblue;">Turkey is one of my all time favorite travel destinations and I am happy to say that Ive already visited it .
        Actually my very first blogging trip was to Turkey! Together with my family I traveled to the fairytale land of Cappadocia! We went on a hot air balloon ride and discovered this wonderful region during 4 incredible days.
        My second blogging trip to Turkey took me to the buzzing city of Istanbul and the travertine terraces of Pamukkale. Both destinations are very different but unforgettable in their own way.
        But I already visited a couple of places in Turkey before I started my blogging and photography adventure. I went on a river cruise on the Dalyan river and drenched myself in a mud bad. I also had the pleasure of visiting the ancient city of Ephesus. Both of them are included in my Turkey itinerary.
        One of my favorite things about visiting Turkey is tasting all of the local food. Theres nothing as fun as sitting down in a quiet street in Istanbul and indulging in a mezze platter. Or maybe try a testi kebap in Cappadocia, an Anatolian speciality prepared in a clay pot or jug. When ready, the jug is brought out and cracked at your table.
        Make sure to save up when visiting Turkey cause its truly a shopping and souvenir paradise! Bring your best haggling tricks with you and go home with something that will forever remind you of this once in a lifetime holiday.
